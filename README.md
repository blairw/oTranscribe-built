# oTranscribe-built
_Built version of oTranscribe_

This is a pre-built version of oTranscribe that you can quickly deploy to any web server, even just a classic Apache `httpd` instance. Just copy the `otranscribe` folder to your web server. There's no server-side database so typically no further configuration is needed.

I made a slight modification to use Lucida Grande because I'm usually working on a pre-Retina Apple Mac.
